                <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Getting started with Cypress development is actually quite easy. Because we consider the development and deployment environments for Cypress as a part of its design and are themselves integrated into the code base, you as a developer don't need to do much to 'configure' your own environment. Cypress has scripts that use <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to automatically create a virtual development environment for you. All the dependencies for building, deploying, running and testing cypress code are cooked into this environment.</p>
<p>The only development dependencies you will need on your machine are</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> version 7.4+</li>
<li>Any of the following
  <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion">VMware Fusion</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation">VMware Workstation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">A Text Editor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="source-code">Source Code</h2>
<p>All of the source code for Cypress lives at <a href="https://github.com/cycps">our GitHub organization site</a>. Here you will find the following repositories, for a big picture idea about what the code contained in each does take a look at the <a href="../arch">Architecture</a> section. The names of the repositories map directly onto their corresponding components in the architecture description.</p>
<h3 id="core-components">Core Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>addie</strong> : design and experimentation automation engine</li>
<li><strong>web</strong> : graphical web-based design environment</li>
<li><strong>data</strong> : back end persistent data storage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="devops">DevOps</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>test</strong> : development/deployment environment model and integration tests</li>
<li><strong>doc</strong> : source for the documentation you are reading</li>
<li><strong>cycps.github.io</strong> : compiled form of the documentation you are reading</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="up-and-running">Up and Running</h2>
<p>The best way to get started with Cypress development is to clone and launch the test environment. This will actually also clone all of the other core component repositories as well. It does this to get fresh copies of the latest stable code from GitHub for the core components, subsequently compiling and launching them in the test environment. Let's get started.</p>
<p>Clone into the Cypress test repository</p>
<pre><code class="shell">$ git clone git@github.com:cycps/test.git
</code></pre>

<p>Go to the test folder and execute the <code>run.rb</code> script. This will launch the Cypress development environment as a collection of Vagrant managed virtual machines. This will take a few minutes. Making startup time quicker <a href="https://github.com/cycps/test/issues/1">is on the radar</a>. You may also be asked which adapter on your host machine to connect bridged adapters in the virtual machines to, please select an adapter that is connected to the internet. Also note that you need internet connectivity for this step as the installation procedure for the machines accesses remote servers for software download in the initial setup.</p>
<pre><code class="shell">$ cd test  
$ ./run.rb  
</code></pre>

<p>When the startup script finished you will have a vagrant development environment with 4 virtual machines. You can verify the environment as follows.  Note that if you are running VirtualBox then the text inside the parentheses to the right of running will say <code>virtualbox</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="shell">$ cd env
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

data                      running (vmware_fusion)
svc                       running (vmware_fusion)
client                    running (vmware_fusion)
web                       running (vmware_fusion)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these virtual machines has Cypress components installed. In fact when the environment was brought up, the source code for each component in the environment was mounted onto its respective machine using NFS, built and then installed on that machine. The NFS mounted source directories are located in a hidden folder called <code>.test</code> located in the <code>test</code> folder we cloned from GitHub. You can edit the sources here locally using your text editor, the changes will be propagated immediately to the virtual environment where you can build and test your changes or additions.</p>
<p>To get a feel for how this works, lets launch the addie/design daemon on the <code>svc</code> VM and then run some API tests that target addi/design from the <code>client</code> VM. You will need two terminal windows for this, each with the CWD in the test/env folder. First let's use Vagrants ssh functionality to bring up a terminal on the <code>svc</code> machine. Once the terminal is up we will launch addie/design.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:red;">Note: this will not work at the moment, I am updating the API, welcome to pre-alpha</span></b></p>
<pre><code class="shell">$ vagrant ssh svc
Welcome to Ubuntu 15.04 (GNU/Linux 3.19.0-15-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
vagrant@addie:~$ design

2015/07/21 00:57:26 Opening connecton to pgdb
2015/07/21 00:57:26 listening ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now that addie/design is up and running, lets fire some tests at it from <code>client</code></p>
<pre><code class="shell">$ vagrant ssh client
Welcome to Ubuntu 15.04 (GNU/Linux 3.19.0-15-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
vagrant@client:~$ cd ~/.cypress/addie/spec/
vagrant@client:~/.cypress/addie/spec$ ./run_dredd_api_tests.sh 
info: Beginning Dredd testing...

</code></pre>

<p>All of the source code folders are mounted at <code>~/.cypress/&lt;project-name&gt;</code>. Now if you wanted to edit the source of addie/design and see if still passes it's client API tests, you could modify the code on your local machine, rebuild addie/test (see addie docs for how to build, install and test addie code) and see if your modifications preserve the results of the tests.</p>
<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>Cypress aims to be a well tested engine. It is our view that tests are just as important as the code itself. The core of the Cypress functionality is exposed through the <code>addie</code> APIs. Thus the most important tests we have are the <code>addie</code> API tests. The goal is that, when developing new features, or fixing bugs, the <code>addie</code> API tests can provide developers with a high level of assurance that new code is not breaking existing functionality or that bug fixes are actually fixing bugs. The first step to fixing any bug is developing a reproducing test case.</p>
<p>Our API test are written as <a href="https://apiblueprint.org">API Blueprint</a> files. The file that we used to run the test above was an API Blueprint file. Lets take a closer look at the <a href="https://github.com/cycps/addie/blob/master/spec/run_dredd_api_tests.sh">run_dredd_apitests.sh</a> we used in the script earlier.</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/http://github.com/cycps/addie/blob/master/spec/run_dredd_api_tests.sh?footer=minimal"></script>

<p>We are using a program called <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd">dredd</a> to automate testing the blueprint. More on dredd in a moment. First let's look at the  API Blueprint file <a href="https://github.com/cycps/addie/blob/master/spec/design.md">design.md</a> that it is using.</p>
<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/http://github.com/cycps/addie/blob/master/spec/design.md?footer=minimal"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">
  $("pre").addClass("linenums");
</script>

<p>The first thing to notice is that this file is really just GitHub markdown. The important part starts at <code>Experiment Update</code> and the partial URL <code>/design/{xpid}</code> that is referenced inside the square brackets. This indicates that the test cases to follow are to be evaluated against the address <code>http://&lt;base_addr&gt;/design/{xpid}</code>, where <code>xpid</code> is in brackets because it is a parameter. In the script above we point dredd at <code>192.168.1.202</code> because that is the development address of <code>addie</code>. In this instance of the blueprint we are supplying the default parameter as <code>xpid=system47</code>. This parameter can also be supplied by tools at test-time like dredd. Following the <code>[POST]</code> directive three request-reply test cases are described in terms of their post content. When dredd is executed over this file it supplies these parameters in the requests and parses responses to ensure they match expectations. This example simply shows creating a computer, updating that computer and then submitting a bad update to <code>addie</code> and expecting an error in return.</p>
<p>The final test cases use the <code>/design/{x}/delete</code> part of the <code>addie/design</code> API to essentially clean up after the test. If cleaning up using the API is for some reason not possible (you should first think about the design and testability of your code) and then use the dredd's hookfile mechanism to execute some cleanup code afterword. We are actually using a 'before-hook' <a href="https://github.com/cycps/addie/blob/master/spec/hookstls.js">hookstls.js</a> in <a href="https://github.com/cycps/addie/blob/master/spec/run_dredd_api_tests.sh">run_dredd_apitests.sh</a> to let the node.js runtime (where dredd runs) that we are OK with the insecure development SSL cert that is coming back from <code>addie</code>.</p>
